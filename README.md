# iSEEtree
Welcome to this repository! This is iSEEtree, an extension of the [iSEE universe](https://isee.github.io/) for panels related to TreeSummarizedExperiment objects. It is currently under development.

## Installation
The development version of iSEEtree can be installed from GitHub as follow:

```
remotes::install_github("RiboRings/iSEEtree")
```

In the future, this package may be submitted to a registry.

## Dependencies
iSEEtree implements the [miaViz](https://microbiome.github.io/miaViz/) package for microbiome data visualisation to create panels that are specific for TreeSummarizedExperiment objects. Not surprisingly, it also depends on the generic panels from iSEE.
